# ds200_assignments
This repository will contain all the code and results for the DS200 course


For the graph plotting experiment, we have used '#Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI), Wave I, 2017-18' dataset from the website https://data.gov.in/

We have plotted the three plots: barplot, boxplot and a lineplot, which are uploaded in this repository.
